bootstrap-scrolling-nav
=======================

A very simple scrolling navigation for Bootstrap 3. I wanted to have a navbar that was larger on initial load, then shrunk slightly once the page scrolled. It turned out to be pretty easy.

Despite its simplicity, this project built using [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). I have included the Gruntfile I've used to process these, as well as minify the CSS and JS.
